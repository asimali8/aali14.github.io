				<h3><a href="#">Final Project: Design Evolution Narrative Draft Nov 27, 2023 </a></h3>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					I designed an application that consolidates order tracking/shipment data into one 
					site allowing users to better organize all their pending orders. I created this 
					because I found the idea to have plenty of potential and real world applicability.
					I personally don't order many items from difference online places, however when
					I do, I find annoyances in sifting through emails to not only find the tracking 
					numbers, but to then take those tracking numbers to their respective sites and 
					attempt to track my orders. From that experience, I understood that there must 
					exist a decent subset of the population that often deal with this issue, especially
					for individuals who constantly online shop and this would drastically improve their 
					online shopping experiences. I also wrote a story which inspired the design about 
					Samantha who was a recent college graduate, moving to a new city, and purchasing her 
					first home. She needed to order furniture and a ton of other household items, but didn't
					want to deal with tracking everything from all sorts of different sites as she already had 
					plenty on her plate. I think I would be great in developing this because I understand the 
					goal at hand and have an idea of how the user would like a simplistic yet practical UI.
					<br>
					I was the sole contributor to this project so I spent a lot of time thinking through 
					my own ideas, while also seeking feedback from many of my peers. The design originally 
					began with the idea of a mobile app as shown by the sketches down below, but I later
					decided to lean more towards a web app as I figured it would be simpler for a user to  
					navigate from shopping sites to the my tracking site.
					<br><br><br>
    					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/sket1.png" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; height: 25%;"></a>
						<br>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/sket2.png" alt="Image" style="width: 40%; height: 25%;"></a>
					<br>
					The prcoess of creating this design really came down to a few things. I knew I wanted this
					to be simple, yet practical. Everything was built around these goals including fonts and 
					colors. I didn't want the color of the site to overblow the content which is why the site
					mainly contains a combination of whites and grays. As shown below, this early iteration of
					the mockup shows the idea I was going for, the colors, and initial font.
					<br><br>
					<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FePpQIIUy6YcRJTrER1Zog8%2FFinal-Project%253A-Design-System%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D30%253A7%26mode%3Ddesign%26t%3DMhNRgJglENJ56SQA-1" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<br>
					The next step in the process was to test how a user would interact with an early iteration of 
					my site. User testing is imporant as it provides feedback for the designer in real time. Below
					is one of the first prototypes created allowing the user to interact with the design. In this 
					prototype, a user is able to navigate between all the main tabs in the header and observe key 
					parts such as how many orders they have enroute as well as how many connected accounts they have.
					<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FQpOcp963QXW7GXirc5Ybuj%2FFinal-Project%253A-Colleague-Assessment%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D103-2%26t%3DSgQjsJT3dOmkORyj-1%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26mode%3Ddesign" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<br><br>
					After the presentation of this prototype, I recieved plently of feedback that I then later improved.
					A couple of key things that stood out in the feedback process was font selection in certain areas,  
					lack of information, and among other things the elimination of using buttons in multiple areas.
					After that experience I was able to make all of those changes. This experience was also very similar
					to the user tests I did. The procedures of the user tests involved navigating through the different pages, 
					adding a new account on the accounts page, and viewing that newly displayed account From the tests I found
					and changed, font selection, removed labels that appeared like buttons, added more descriptive labeling
					above items, displayed more detail on the accounts page, and lastly changed the way the account names appeared on
					both the dashboard and accounts page. Below is what the mockup looked like after these 5 changes were implemented
					<br><br>
					<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FQpOcp963QXW7GXirc5Ybuj%2FFinal-Project%253A-Colleague-Assessment%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D337-4%26t%3DUpcn2FcoP4LKtNiR-1%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26page-id%3D337%253A3%26mode%3Ddesign" allowfullscreen></iframe>
					<br><br>
					Overall, throughout his design process, I learned a lot. Again, the main values I strived to have were simplicity 
					and practicality and I believe my UI is consistent with those values.

				<h3><a href="#">UIUN Negotiation Reflection Nov 5, 2023</a></h3>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					The UIUN Summit was an experience where we were able to represent a population 
					of users to create an election site UI that better fit their needs. We found people with common
					and unique challenges and ensured that their experiences were not negated by those 
					obstacles. In this summit, we were also able to meet with other teams who were representing 
					a seperate population of users. In meeting with these teams, we brought our ideas to the table 
					and negotiated what we believed would be required to increase the inclusivity of the site.
					The population we represented suffers from hand tremors. Hand tremors are a neurological condition
					in the hands that cause shaking movements. People that suffer from this deal with many challenges
					in their every day lives. What we learned they needed, what we fought for most, and our original recommendations came down 
					to the fact that interfaces should have larger buttons to account for users struggling to click buttons
					of normal sizes. We kept our requirements simple, therfor not causing any significant changes throughout
					the negoiations. We had a fairly smooth process when negoiating which didn't require significant convicining.
					Obviously not everything can go everyone's way when negoiating so it is interesting to see how everyone generally
					prioritizes their wants and believes it is the most important thing and fortunately we didn't experience much trouble here.
					One of the biggest takeaways from the summit was how well people presented issues from their to each other. There were 
					great ideas all around and they were interesting to see. I think negoiating in generall is a very imporant skill 
					and being able to apply that to multiple areas is extremely important.

					#FreeForm

				<p>
					This first video highlihgts three points which include research,
					preparing your portfolio, and take a close look at the job requirements.
					Researching is important in order to get a better understanding of the 
					company you're interviewing for which in turn allows you to be more 
					successful during the interview itself. In doing so, you're able to not only
					answer the interviewer's questions, but ask some yourself. Preparing your portfolio 
					is important so that you adequetly showcase your skills and past work. Since you are
					applying for a UI role, its critical this page looks nice. Lastly, observing the job requiements
					is important because you're then able to undertand if your skills fit the needs the employer is looking for. 
					Knowing this can allow you to better undertand if you are aligned for this role or not
					<br>
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtN3yHIWuRY">
					First Video Link</a>
					<br>
					This second video mainly covers common interview question asked and how to go about answering them.
					The first common question asked is "what is your favorite digital project and why?" The key to understanding
					the premise of this question is the interviewer wants to know how well you can articulate and define
					what you believe to be a good product. The second common question asked is "why do you want to work here?"
					Like many place, this is a common question in general, but in answering its imporant to prioriize the wants
					of the company. Many people explain why they want to work for a company, but neglect including why they 
					would be of value to the employer which is really what the interviewer would be looking for in this type of question.
					The last commonly asked question is "can you walk me through one of your projects?" What is generally looked for in 
					a question like this is not detailing each of the steps one by one, but rather where you made your decisions and why,
					what obstacles you ran into and how you overcame them, and how well you worked with others.

					#ApproximateAnalogy
				</p>
				<p>
					Imagine a city's transportation system, where the majority
					of the roads are narrow and winding, making it challenging
					for large vehicles to navigate smoothly. Despite the
					availability of advanced technology that could widen
					the roads and streamline the traffic, the city continues
					to function with its existing infrastructure. Implementing
					changes would require a complete overhaul of the roads, affecting
					numerous businesses and residents who have adapted to the current
					layout. Even though a better design could enhance the overall 
					efficiency and convenience, the city remains reluctant to initiate 
					the transformation due to the massive disruptions it would cause.
					This is important to remember in ones career as there are many implications 
					of the legacy problem. Many industries may resist change due to the potential
					disruptions it could cause, even if a more efficient and effective alternative
					exists. Understanding the challenges associated with legacy systems can help 
					individuals navigate corporate environments where there might be resistance 
					to adopting new technologies or methodologies.

					The word I chose for this section is "empowerment." The reason 
					for choosing this word is that the passage highlights the need 
					for a shift in perspective and tools to empower designers and 
					developers to create accessible websites without requiring them 
					to become accessibility experts. Empowerment is essential to 
					remember in one's career because it emphasizes the importance 
					of creating inclusive and accessible products. By empowering 
					individuals with the knowledge and tools to make their designs 
					and developments accessible, we can ensure that everyone, regardless
					 of ability, can access and benefit from digital content. It also 
					 encourages professionals to seek out and utilize tools that simplify 
					 the process of incorporating accessibility into their work, leading 
					 to a more inclusive and user-friendly digital environment.

					I chose the word "iterative" because this word because the 
					passage emphasizes the importance of conducting small, early 
					tests and making incremental improvements throughout the development 
					process. Recognizing the iterative nature of testing and development 
					can be essential in one's career as an iterative approach can help 
					professionals in various industries to continuously refine and improve 
					their work. By conducting small tests early in the project, teams can 
					gather valuable insights and make necessary adjustments before major 
					issues arise. This approach can lead to more efficient development 
					cycles, reduced costs, and a higher likelihood of meeting user expectations.

					I chose the word "adaptability" because the section discusses

				<h3><a href="#">Finding Inspiration, Oct 8, 2023</a></h3>
				<br>
				<p>
					The piece I chose to analyze is the "Old Glory" by Mark Di Suvero. Suvero
					was born in Shanghai, China in 1933 & has created several pieces that resemble
					Old Glory. I was shocked at this finding after looking him up to see
					there existed several sculptures that eerily similar to the piece on 
					campus I've been observing all my life. Despite passing by hundreds if
					not thousands of times, I finally had a reason to study this piece more closely.
					Before finding its way to Lincoln, NE in 1987, Suvero spent 1986 constructing Old 
					Glory in Socrates Sculpture Park located in Long Island City, Queens, NY. He also
					created Socrates Sculpture Park in the same year & the park still stands as 
					an outdoor museum aimed for artists to create & showcase their sculptures.
					<br>
					One point of analysis I will focus on is the color of Old Glory. Alone, the color 
					shouldn't stand out as anything too unique as its simply just a shade of red.
					It wasn't until I again looked into the artist to then realize that not only
					do the majority of his sculptures follow the same patterns, but are also almost 
					always red. I couldn't find a definitive reason as to why this is, but this
					<a href="https://lorimcnee.com/use-the-hidden-meaning-of-the-color-red-in-art-design/"> article </a>
					discusses varying meanings the color red can represent in artwork ranging from 
					strength, excitement, and vitality.
					<br>
					My next point of analysis will focus on visual direction, which generally refers
					to the use of certain elements to guide the user's eyes in order to have them focus
					on a specific area of the design. This 
					<a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/visual-direction-in-web-design--webdesign-2545a"> article </a>
					highlights this idea in further detail when it comes to web design and provides examples of both 
					obvious instances and not so obvious ones. I wanted to observe if this phenomenon was also present
					when it came to physical sculptures like Suvero's. With the way the Old Glory sculpture is set up, 
					I find it difficult discovering if there is indeed an intended visual direction & I think it depends
					on the angle in which you are viewing the piece. On one side, the focus point to you can be one thing 
					& on the opposite side it can be completely different. To me, when I view Old Glory, my eyes go 
					straight to the bottom half & the center of the sculpure. I believe this is due to me focusing my
					attention on how the sculpture stands & its supportive base, as well as how the center supports the
					top portion
					<br>
					My last point of analysis will cover the sculpture's placement. In art, where sculptures should 
					exist is commonly referred to as "placement." The setting in which a sculpture exists plays 
					a critical role in perception that viewers will have when observing the art. Firstly, Old Glory exists 
					in an outdoor open space surrounded by grass & trees. It's difficult to discuss Old Glory's placement 
					without acknowledging it's size. The biggest question I have is did Suvero decide on the size of sculpture
					followed by where it would be placed or was the placement factored in first. There is a possibility that 
					it's also neither. This
					<a href="https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/visual-direction-in-web-design--webdesign-2545a"> article </a>
					goes into detail on the differences between indoor & outdoor sculptures & also describes how outdoor
					sculpture in general was created with a more defined purpose.
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/uhsketch.jpg" /></a>
					<br>
					The UI I decided to sketch is of an investment brokerage mobile app. Suvero's Old Glory & my sketch 
					don't look anything alike & in fact are really not related at all. With that being said,
					the 3 points of analysis I chose when evaluating his sculpture is what motivated me to chose what I did
					Color, visual direction, & placement are all factors that I took into account on my sketch. For color,
					the visualization of the portfolio performance will include colors that aren't distracting, but draw 
					the user's eyes towards the graph. The graph also includes two line, one being the portfolio's performance
					and the other being the compared benchamrk's. The usage of colors here will highlight either which is
					outperforming at any given time.
					<br>
					I believe that throughout this process I was able to learn more about potential motivations behind specific
					pieces of art & how to analyze those pieces. Needless to say, understanding an artist is extremely important
					when trying to evaluate & understand a piece of art further.

					The video involved learning how to build a design system form

					Analyzing my screenshot below, the interface is Canva & tends to be
					a good example of the guidelines in the video. The color shades on
					the homepage are consistent with Figma's for one & have great contrast

					mixture/blending of multiple colors, but keeps it easy & nice to view.

					The word I chose from my section is "time." The writer

					generally don't fully understand the value of until later in 
					life when we feel we have less of it. Time is essential in
					everything and learning how to manage it well is important
					for all careers. Understanding that you have a finite amount
					of it is critical.

					A. The spotify app has a main theme of black & green, 
					with green fitting the harmonious combination of blue & yello
					<br>
					B. Immediately with the black background it provides a soothing 
					theme which is great when opening up a music app. The green adds 
					the hint of excitement necessary. I think this design was intentional 
					particularly on the desktop application as many users would likely turn 
					on soothing music or complementary music to go along with the work they're doing.

					<br>
					<p>
						I believe the most effective color scheme is either the original black or the blue I created. 
						Spotify is already a well created UI & I think an effective color scheme is one in which the 
						content remains the main focus with colors that aren't too distracting. The blue is also effective 
						as it again, doesn't distract the user, but also maintains an asthetically pleasing view.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						I was able to change the color of the UI in multiple ways while also keeping the simplicity of the 
						Spotify experience in tact. If something isn't broken, not breaking it is important. The differing color
						schemes are able to represent users in different ways and different moods. Since all music has a vibe and tone
						its important to represent that in the user experience of the app.

					which led me to the work courier which is known commonly as

					I chose the word "evolution" because this section discusses 
					the evolution of design concepts, particularly the shift from 
					a focus on affordances to signifiers. It highlights how the 
					field of design has evolved in its understanding of how users 
					interact with both physical and virtual objects. The concept 
					of this evolution is important to remember in one's career 
					because it emphasizes the dynamic nature of design principles. 
					Designers should be open to adapting their approaches as new 
					concepts and understandings emerge. The shift from affordances 
					to signifiers underscores the importance of clear communication 
					and signaling in design, particularly in the context of digital 
					and virtual interfaces. Staying open to evolving concepts and 
					methodologies is crucial for remaining effective and relevant 
					in the field of design.
